'break' Keyword in the switch Statement
	The break keyword in a switch statement stops the program from running the next cases after a match is found. 
	Without a break, the program will keep running the following cases, even if they don't match.

'default' Keyword in the switch Statement
	The default keyword in a switch statement is used when no other case matches the value. 
	It acts like an "else" statement and runs when none of the specified cases are true. Including a 
	default case is optional, but it's useful to handle unexpected values.


Why do we use Switch Statements instead of if-else statements?
	* Readability: When you have a number of criteria to compare to a single value or expression, 
	  the switch statements can help make the code easier to understand. Coding understanding and 
	  organization are enhanced by the representation of individual branches of logic in each situation.

	* Efficiency: Switch statements are often more efficient than long chains of if-else statements because 
	  they use a jump table or similar mechanisms, resulting in faster execution for large numbers of cases.

	* Intent: Using a switch statement conveys the intention that you are comparing a single value against 
	  multiple possible values, making your code more self-explanatory.

	* Maintenance: Switch statements are easier to maintain when you need to add or remove cases 
	  because you only need to modify the switch block, whereas if-else chains require changes throughout the code.

	* Enumerations: Switch statements work well with enumerated types, making code cleaner and less error-prone 
	  when dealing with predefined sets of values.

	* Code Quality: Code analyzers and compilers can better optimize switch statements, leading to 
	  potentially more efficient and error-free code.


Disadvantages of switch Statement
	1. Limited to Constant Values
	   Cannot use ranges, conditions, or variables in case labels (unless using pattern matching in newer C# versions).

	2. No Logical Expressions
	   Doesn’t support complex logical comparisons like if (x > 5 && x < 10).

	3. Risk of Missing break
	   Forgetting the break statement may cause logical errors or compile-time errors in C#.

	4. Not Ideal for Complex Logic
	  Becomes hard to manage or understand when each case involves lengthy or nested logic.
